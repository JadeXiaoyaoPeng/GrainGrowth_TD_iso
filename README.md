# GrainGrowth_TD_iso
Read experiment microstructures, model grain growth with isotropic Threshold Dynamics and write the simulated microstructure.
This work follows the isotropic threshold dynamics algorithm in: 
Esedoglu, S.; Otto, F. Threshold dynamics for networks with arbitrary surface tensions. Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics. 68:5 (2015), pp. 808-864.
And the code is adapted from the following link to be able to used for experiment microstructures.
